ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I achieved all requirements for this task, and also added a delete function for posts, added deskptop/mobile view, dynamic routes for each game's reviews and some basic styling.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I had hoped to add a 'sort by' button, but didn't have the time to decipher the logic behind it.
I had also hoped to use the genres option I wrote in my database tables, but couldn't figure out how to send data to two different tables using only one form.

Overall, this task went very well but I failed to add the complexities I would have liked, mainly due to a busy schedule during the week off and partially because of the way I chose to allocate data to the different database tables.
